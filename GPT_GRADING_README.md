## Implementation Details

### Database Schema

The `attempts` table includes a `gptFeedback` JSONB field that stores:

```json
{
  "score": 8,
  "maxPoints": 10,
  "feedback": "Excellent explanation of photosynthesis...",
  "confidence": 95,
  "reasoning": "Student demonstrated comprehensive understanding...",
  "keywords": ["chlorophyll", "glucose", "oxygen"],
  "suggestions": ["Include more details about light reactions"],
  "gradedAt": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "error": false
}
```

### Grading Criteria

The AI evaluates answers based on:

1. **Content Accuracy (40%)**: Does the answer address the question correctly?
2. **Completeness (30%)**: Does the answer cover the key points?
3. **Clarity (20%)**: Is the answer well-expressed and understandable?
4. **Originality (10%)**: Does the answer show independent thinking?

### Scoring Guidelines

- **90-100%**: Excellent - Comprehensive, accurate, well-articulated
- **80-89%**: Good - Mostly accurate with minor gaps
- **70-79%**: Satisfactory - Generally correct but incomplete
- **60-69%**: Needs Improvement - Some correct elements but significant gaps
- **50-59%**: Poor - Minimal understanding shown
- **0-49%**: Unsatisfactory - Incorrect or irrelevant

## Usage

### For Students

1. **Take a quiz** with short answer questions
2. **Submit answers** - AI grading happens automatically
3. **Review results** with detailed feedback
4. **Learn from suggestions** for improvement

### For Professors

1. **Create quizzes** with short answer questions
2. **View student attempts** with AI feedback
3. **Monitor grading quality** via confidence scores
4. **Review detailed analytics** per question

### For Developers

#### Testing the System

Visit `/test-grading` to test the GPT grading functionality:

```bash
# Start the development server
npm run dev

# Navigate to http://localhost:3000/test-grading
```

#### API Testing

Test the grading API directly:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/test-grading \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "question": "Explain photosynthesis",
    "studentAnswer": "Plants use sunlight to make food",
    "correctAnswer": "Photosynthesis converts light energy to chemical energy",
    "maxPoints": 10
  }'
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Add to your `.env.local`:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

### API Settings

The system uses:
- **Model**: `gpt-4-turbo-preview`
- **Temperature**: `0.3` (for consistency)
- **Max Tokens**: `500`
- **Response Format**: JSON

## Error Handling

### Fallback Scenarios

1. **No OpenAI API Key**: Uses basic keyword matching
2. **API Rate Limits**: Implements delays between requests
3. **Invalid Responses**: Validates JSON structure
4. **Network Errors**: Graceful degradation with fallback scoring

### Error Recovery

- **Automatic retries** for transient failures
- **Fallback grading** with basic analysis
- **User notification** of grading issues
- **Detailed logging** for debugging

## Performance Considerations

### Cost Management

- **Sequential processing** to avoid rate limits
- **Efficient prompts** to minimize token usage
- **Caching opportunities** for similar questions
- **Batch processing** for multiple questions

### Response Times

- **Typical grading**: 2-5 seconds per question
- **Fallback mode**: < 1 second
- **Batch processing**: Adds 100ms delay between questions

## Security

### Data Protection

- **No answer storage** in OpenAI logs (configurable)
- **Input validation** to prevent prompt injection
- **Rate limiting** to prevent abuse
- **Error sanitization** to avoid information leakage

## Monitoring

### Key Metrics

- **Grading success rate**
- **Average confidence scores**
- **API response times**
- **Error frequency**
- **Cost per question**

### Logging

The system logs:
- Grading requests and responses
- Error conditions and fallbacks
- Performance metrics
- API usage statistics

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features

1. **Custom Grading Rubrics**: Professor-defined criteria
2. **Learning Analytics**: Track improvement over time
3. **Peer Comparison**: Relative performance insights
4. **Multi-language Support**: International student support
5. **Advanced Analytics**: Detailed performance breakdowns

### Technical Improvements

1. **Response Caching**: Reduce API calls for similar questions
2. **Batch Optimization**: Parallel processing where possible
3. **Model Selection**: Choose optimal model per question type
4. **Cost Optimization**: Smart token usage strategies

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"OpenAI API key not configured"**
   - Add `OPENAI_API_KEY` to environment variables

2. **"Grading temporarily unavailable"**
   - Check OpenAI API status
   - Verify API key permissions
   - Review rate limits

3. **"Invalid JSON response"**
   - Check OpenAI API response format
   - Review prompt engineering
   - Validate response schema

### Debug Mode

Enable detailed logging by setting:

```env
DEBUG_GRADING=true
```

This will log all API requests, responses, and processing steps.
