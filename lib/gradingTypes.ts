/**
 * Shared types for the deterministic rubric-based grading system.
 *
 * Design contract (see `grading_deterministic_redesign` plan):
 * - Scores are computed in TypeScript from rubric matches, not invented by the
 *   model. Out-of-range scores are impossible by construction.
 * - A grading failure NEVER becomes a numeric score. It becomes a `pending`
 *   StoredFeedback entry that a background worker will retry.
 * - StoredFeedback is forward-compatible with the legacy
 *   `{ score, feedback, confidence, maxPoints }` shape: legacy entries (no
 *   `status` field) are treated as `'graded'` so existing data renders fine.
