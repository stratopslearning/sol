  {
    question: "Explain the difference between centralized and decentralized procurement.",
    studentAnswer: "Centralized procurement means all purchasing decisions are made from one location, while decentralized means each department makes their own decisions.",
    correctAnswer: "Centralized procurement consolidates all purchasing decisions under a single authority, enabling better negotiation power, standardized processes, and cost savings. Decentralized procurement allows individual departments or locations to make purchasing decisions independently, providing flexibility and local responsiveness but potentially missing economies of scale.",
