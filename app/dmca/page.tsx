      </p>

          <strong>Name:</strong> DMCA Agent, {LEGAL_ENTITY}
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Email:</strong>{" "}

        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Mail:</strong>
          <br />
          {address.map((line) => (
            <span key={line}>
              {line}
              <br />
            </span>
          ))}
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The designated agent must also be registered with the U.S. Copyright
        Office DMCA Designated Agent Directory for safe-harbor eligibility.
        Filing is a separate Copyright Office process (nominal fee).
      </p>

      <h2>2. What to include in a takedown notice</h2>
      <p>Your written notice should include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed
        </li>
        <li>
          Identification of the material claimed to be infringing, and
          information reasonably sufficient to locate it on SOL (URL, course,
          object id, or screenshot)
        </li>
        <li>
          Your contact information (name, mailing address, telephone, email)
        </li>
        <li>

        </li>
        <li>
          A statement, under penalty of perjury, that the information in the
          notice is accurate and that you are the owner or authorized to act on
          behalf of the owner
        </li>
        <li>Your physical or electronic signature</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. Counter-notification</h2>
      <p>
        If your material was removed and you believe the removal was a mistake
        or misidentification, you may send a counter-notification to the same
        agent with the elements required by 17 U.S.C. § 512(g), including your
        consent to jurisdiction of the federal district court for your address
        (or any district where {LEGAL_ENTITY} may be found), and your signature.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Repeat infringers</h2>
      <p>
        We may terminate accounts of users who are determined to be repeat
        infringers in appropriate circumstances, consistent with institutional
        agreements and applicable law.
